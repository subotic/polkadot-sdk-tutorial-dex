# Introduction to Building a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Pallet with the Polkadot SDK

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on building a decentralized exchange pallet using the powerful Polkadot SDK.
This tutorial aims to provide a step-by-step approach, empowering you to create a custom DEX within the Polkadot
ecosystem.

It is highly recommended that you complete the tutorial
on [Rust State Machine](https://github.com/shawntabrizi/rust-state-machine0)
before you begin this tutorial to get an understanding of the general features on Substrate.

The tutorial is broken into sections which cover specific learning goals for the reader, and can act as good pause
points if you need them.

All of the content of this tutorial is open source, free to access, and can be

If you have suggestions which can improve the tutorial, comments, issues and pull requests are welcome.

Without further ado, enjoy and I hope you learn a ton!

## Intro to DEXs

**Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)** have gained significant popularity in the blockchain ecosystem due to their ability to facilitate trustless and permissionless trading of digital assets. One of the key components of a DEX is the concept of liquidity pools.

**Liquidity pools** are essentially reserves of tokens that are locked in a smart contract to provide liquidity for trading pairs. They allow users to trade tokens without the need for a central order book or matching engine. Instead, the prices of tokens in a liquidity pool are determined by an automated market maker (AMM) algorithm based on the ratio of tokens in the pool.

In a DEX, liquidity providers contribute their tokens to the liquidity pools and earn a portion of the trading fees generated by the trades that occur within the pool. This incentivizes users to supply liquidity and helps maintain a healthy trading ecosystem.

To build a functional DEX pallet in Substrate, we need to implement the core functionalities of minting, burning, and swapping tokens. Here's a brief overview of each function:

- **Mint**: The mint function allows liquidity providers to add tokens to a liquidity pool. When a user mints liquidity, they deposit a proportional amount of each token in the trading pair into the pool. In return, they receive liquidity tokens representing their share of the pool.
- **Burn**: The burn function enables liquidity providers to remove their tokens from a liquidity pool. When a user burns their liquidity tokens, they redeem their share of the underlying tokens from the pool, effectively withdrawing their liquidity.
- **Swap**: The swap function allows users to trade one token for another within a liquidity pool. When a user initiates a swap, the DEX pallet calculates the exchange rate based on the current ratio of tokens in the pool and the desired amount to be swapped. The tokens are then transferred between the user and the liquidity pool accordingly.

Let's setup our pallet project first.
